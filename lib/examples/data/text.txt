In computer programming, Flow-Based Programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm that
uses a "data factory" metaphor for designing and building applications. FBP defines
applications as networks of "black box" processes, which exchange data across
predefined connections by message passing, where the connections are specified
externally to the processes. These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly
to form different applications without having to be changed internally. FBP is
thus naturally component-oriented.
